Find all local optima in an MK Landscape using hyperplane elimination.
==

To compile you will need C++11.  We use gcc version 4.8.2 for our complilation.

Our build system uses Makefiles to build.  You can compile the release version
by changing directory to Release and calling "make MKL".

All of the source code is available in the 'src' directory.

To run an experiment, call the executable with command line arguments for configuration.
If you run with no arguments you will see the help message explaining all arguments:

Release/MKL

Also, see main.cpp for implementation related details.
